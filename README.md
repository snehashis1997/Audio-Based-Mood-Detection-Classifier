# Audio Based Mood Detection Classier using Python

This is my work in SkyBits Technologies Pvt Ltd (http://sky-bits.com/) from 1st August, 2019 to 30th September, 2019. During this time, I was to design a novel machine learning based model where using my Laptopâ€™s microphone it recorded 15 sec audio and divided 15sec audio into three parts, took decision for each part whether that part was loudly or non-loudly.

# Dataset description

-- The given problem dataset is not present in opensource, so I have to create this dataset. At first,  downloded some movie clips,then extract the audios from those clips.

-- Then, make short audio clips (15 secs) length, compute the MFCCs and plot the spectrogram in dB scale.

# Libraries:

1. Pandas -- for tabular dataset handeling

2. Numpy -- for array related works

3. Scipy -- for peak detection and gaussian smoothing

4. Scikit learn -- for building SVM based classification model

5. librosa -- for audio signal processing anf MFCC spectrogram plotting

6. Pyaudio -- for record audio from laptop's microphone


# My work

Here I worked with some Bio medical signals.  I used some preprocessing stpes like abrupt Peak finding, removing noise by Gausiinan filtering (see notebook: name of the file)
Then using histrogram plots try to create some class.

At first I solved the given problem as a regression problem, later I solved the problem as a classification problem.

So, in regression problem, I tried to use diffrent regression algorithims like SVR,Random forest(Bagging), XGBOOST(Boosting).

Also the given dataset was very much imbalanced, so while solving classification problems I used Imblearn library's SMOTE algorithim to reduce imblance.
