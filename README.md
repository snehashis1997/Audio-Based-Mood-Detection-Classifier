# Audio Based Mood Detection Classier using Python

This is my work in SkyBits Technologies Pvt Ltd (http://sky-bits.com/) from 1st August, 2019 to 30th September, 2019. During this time, I was to design a novel machine learning based model where using my Laptopâ€™s microphone it recorded 15 sec audio and divided 15sec audio into three parts, took decision for each part whether that part was loudly or non-loudly.
